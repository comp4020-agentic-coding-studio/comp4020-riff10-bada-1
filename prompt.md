# Build quickly, then live with the factory you built

## What we want

Give Plenty a clear, satisfying factory progression: gather raw resources,
process them into parts, claim land, build a datacentre, automate supply, then
improve the network. A datacentre should be an earned early milestone with a
short, understandable supply chain. It must still be easy to reach quickly
using cheap, inefficient and environmentally destructive methods.

Reward those shortcuts immediately: faster harvesting, cheaper construction,
more output and earlier compute. Their consequences emerge through continued
play: wasted deposits, damaged land, thirsty cooling, heat, overloaded supply
lines and an energy reserve that runs out sooner. Sustainable harvesting and
construction require more materials, planning and setup, but reward sustained
operation and endgame play. A speedrunner can deliberately skip them and still
finish. Players can mix approaches and retrofit later; neither route is a
mandatory moral choice or a permanent class selected at the start.

This expands the previous datacentre brief. Keep manufactured goods and land
claims, but replace the idea that the datacentre must be the last building with
an arc where it unlocks a substantial automation and optimisation phase.

## Inspiration and scale

Read these references for design principles, then adapt them to Plenty's small
maps and short cooperative sessions:

- [Satisfactory's official overview](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/): use
  visible production chains, belts and pipes, and the satisfaction of reducing
  manual labour. Its construction, exploration and automation loop is the
  inspiration for arranging a working setup and improving it.
- [Factorio's official overview](https://www.factorio.com/): connect resource
  extraction, manufacturing and infrastructure so each new capability creates
  an understandable demand on the previous stage.
- [Factorio modules](https://wiki.factorio.com/Module) and
  [pollution](https://wiki.factorio.com/Pollution): use explicit trade-offs
  between production speed, resource efficiency, energy use and environmental
  impact. Our consequences should emerge from the economy and landscape.

Keep the implementation compact: a small recipe set, simple grid connections,
bounded buffers and a few meaningful upgrades. No trains, vehicles, combat,
large research tree, detailed fluid physics or hundreds of component types.
The sustainability mechanics below are this game's design direction, not a
claim that either reference game implements them in the same way.

## The progression on every world

1. **Survey and gather.** Show the nearest deposits and the materials needed
   for the next useful building. Hand harvesting always works without power,
   compute or ownership. Make metal visibly collectable on Earth: relabel the
   existing `mineral` family as metal ore and update its presentation, or add
   deposits only if that is demonstrably cleaner. Prefer retaining the three
   existing resource families and their conservation ledger.
2. **Establish workers and power.** Build basic housing and a cheap power
   source. Baseline housing must supply workers before it receives compute.
   Lay a short cable connection to the first production area. Renewable power
   is an optional larger investment where the world's existing rules allow it.
3. **Manufacture parts.** Add a Factory, powered and staffed but requiring
   **zero compute**, which makes wire and structural frames. Start with hand
   deliveries. The first factory must be buildable from raw stock, as must the
   cables and other equipment necessary to run it. No circular dependencies.
4. **Claim and build.** Claim a small plot and build a datacentre entirely
   inside it using wire, frames and a little raw stock. Provide workers, power
   and coolant. Show all shortages before construction and operating shortages
   afterwards. Claiming should be a quick spatial decision, not a long grind.
5. **Automate the supply.** Compute enables Harvesters. Connect their output
   to factories with belts, bring coolant through pipes, and extend electricity
   to the new machines. The first complete loop should visibly reduce manual
   work. Factories also keep producing parts for expansion and upgrades.
6. **Find the bottleneck.** More extraction exposes limited factory throughput;
   more factories expose power, coolant and transport limits. Players decide
   whether to add cheap capacity, overwork the existing setup, shorten routes,
   improve recipes or invest in efficient equipment.
7. **Optimise or rush onward.** A hurried setup advances sooner but consumes
   more stock per useful result. A carefully planned setup delivers more useful
   production from finite inputs and runs longer before shortages. Preserve
   the world's existing exact-exhaustion transition: these milestones guide
   play, and are not new mandatory gates for leaving a world.

For a normal-pace group of two to four players, initially target a useful
factory in the first couple of minutes and a rushed first datacentre around
three to five minutes. These are tuning targets, not measured claims. The
first ten minutes should include successful automation and an improvement
choice. Do not achieve progression by adding long timers or inflated costs.
Measure and adjust targets against the actual game and player count.

## Recipes and manufacturing

Use a small explicit recipe table in `shared/content.ts`. Starting values may
be tuned after testing; preserve the differences between the routes:

| Recipe | Quick production | Efficient production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wire | 3 mineral -> 2 wire in 1 batch interval | 3 mineral -> 3 wire in 2 intervals |
| Frame | 4 mineral + 3 matter -> 1 frame in 1 interval | 3 mineral + 2 matter -> 1 frame in 2 intervals |
| Efficiency kit | 2 wire + 1 frame -> 1 kit | Same recipe; a deliberate investment |

A first datacentre might require 6 wire and 2 frames plus raw stock. Tune this
alongside the whole bootstrap budget, including housing, factory, power,
cables and any world-specific support. Do not require efficiency kits for the
first datacentre or the completion of a campaign.

Factories have a selected recipe, visible input/output buffers, batch progress,
and an optional output target that pauses production once enough is made.
Recipe changes cannot duplicate committed inputs or reset progress for free.
Offer a simple default that produces the parts for the next datacentre, so a
new player need not manage a complicated queue. Clearly distinguish missing
inputs, insufficient power/workers and a full output buffer.

Installing an efficiency kit unlocks the factory's efficient recipes, or
improves a supported building's operating costs. Make the installed benefit
specific in the inspect panel. Use one upgrade tier initially. Retrofitting
costs real parts and improves future operation; it cannot undo earlier damage.

## Simple travel, electricity, water and conveyor mechanisms

Layout must affect the setup. Implement these four mechanisms with a clear
placement preview, total cost, connected/disconnected state and inspectable
benefit. Use grid-aligned segments and endpoint selection or short drag paths.
Connections of different types can cross without becoming the same network.
Keep movement possible everywhere and all remaining deposits reachable.

| Network | Simple mechanism | Meaningful choice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Travel lines | Paths give players a movement bonus while travelling along them; ordinary walking remains available everywhere. | A cheap direct route is quick to build but damages more living ground. A carefully routed, more expensive low-impact path preserves more land. Shorter routes reduce delivery time. |
| Electricity | Cables connect generators to consumers. Connected supply is finite; disconnected machines cannot draw from a magical room-wide pool. | Furnaces provide cheap compact power with fuel and pollution costs; solar needs investment and ground. Short shared cable routes use fewer materials; efficient machines reduce demand and late-game reserve drain. |
| Water/coolant | An intake beside a coolant deposit feeds a bounded tank and connected pipes; hand-filled tanks provide a bootstrap fallback. | Cheap pipes have a small, explicit loss rate; sealed pipes cost more and conserve coolant. Recirculation upgrades reduce net consumption without creating water. Longer wasteful networks drain finite sources sooner. |
| Conveyor belts | Directed segments transfer whole units of raw material or manufactured goods between adjacent ports and bounded buffers at a capped rate. | Cheap belts suit a small rushed factory; parallel lines or one upgrade tier increase capacity at a material/power cost. Short balanced routes reduce transport delay and blocked machines. |

Travel lines are paths in this version; no vehicle simulation is required.
For power and pipes, connected components with a fixed transfer budget are
sufficient. For belts, one discrete movement step per economy tick is enough;
items cannot traverse an entire long belt instantaneously. Define a consistent
junction policy, such as round-robin splitting, and show direction arrows.
Avoid elaborate routing controls: one simple splitter/junction is enough.

Preserve the communal stockpile for hand gathering and construction. Automated
machines use explicit local buffers and connections. A player standing nearby
can load a machine from the shared stockpile or collect its output into it.
A small store/depot can bridge a belt endpoint to the shared stockpile. Explain
that abstraction in the UI; factories must not silently pull inputs across the
map when their intended supply line is disconnected. This keeps manual setup
possible while making automated logistics useful.

Intakes and initial transport must not require datacentre compute; Harvesters
still do. Every powered network component has an explicit operating cost.
Idle, blocked or disconnected components must not consume inputs as if they
were producing. Define stable allocation when supply is insufficient so the
same machine does not win accidentally because of client message ordering.
Keep workers and compute shared unless an existing world rule says otherwise.

Show pipeline losses as consumed coolant from already-extracted stock. For
integer accounting, use persisted counters, for example losing one unit per
N transferred, rather than rounding tiny losses to zero. Save these counters
so reconnecting or toggling a mode cannot erase costs. Water recovery reduces
net withdrawals; it never refills natural deposits or creates an infinite loop.

## Fast extraction and sustainable building

Provide an understandable harvesting choice before automation, then carry the
same trade-off into Harvesters:

- **Intensive harvesting:** more useful resources per action/tick, but removes
  additional natural stock as waste and causes more local damage. For example,
  take 2 useful units and destroy 1 additional unit when enough remains.
- **Careful harvesting:** slower useful output, minimal additional destruction
  and reduced collateral damage. It remains possible to take the last unit.
  Automated careful operation may require an efficiency kit to reach its best
  performance, making sustained efficiency an investment.

Clamp both useful extraction and destruction to stock actually present. Record
useful output as `extracted`, collateral loss as `destroyed`, and reduce the
deposit by their sum. Display the expected yield and waste before the action.
Consumption of stock already in an inventory must not be counted a second time
as destruction of a natural deposit.

Offer standard and efficient construction for major production buildings and
infrastructure. Standard construction is affordable, quick and rough on the
site. Efficient construction costs additional parts and setup time, reduces
construction damage and improves a stated operating cost. A datacentre might
use less coolant per sustained compute output; a factory uses less material
per part; a sealed pipe wastes less water. Avoid an upgrade that improves every
stat with no trade-off. All footprints still obey deposit placement rules.

Every major build, harvest mode and network choice should expose its concrete
cost, throughput, resource use and local impact. Do not invent a universal
morality score. Sustainable layouts can still consume a finite world; they
extract more useful work from it and leave a different history on the way.

## Levels and how their decisions evolve

Keep the five existing worlds and their order. Reuse the core chain and the
same small goods/network system, with stage-appropriate names in `STAGES`.
Each world introduces a new constraint rather than restarting a long tutorial.

### Earth: learn the loop and see the cost

Gather timber, ore and water; build Cottages and a Furnace or Sun Garden; run
a Factory; manufacture wire/frames; claim a plot; connect and start a
Datacentre. Then add a Harvester, a short belt and piped cooling. Teach one
connection at a time through the goal checklist.

The fast route uses intensive gathering, compact furnace power, standard
construction and cheap pipes. It reaches compute first. Continued use burns
fuel and nearby groves, wastes ore and drains the pond. The sustainable route
invests in Sun Gardens, careful extraction, sealed cooling and efficient
recipes. It takes longer to establish but retains useful stock and operating
capacity. Pollution and named places make the consequences visible.

### Mars: coordinate a colony around scarce ice

Start with enough raw materials to establish a Dome, Solar Field and Hab Block.
Build the stage's Factory inside supported air, make parts, claim ground and
bring a Cold Datacentre online. Rover Drills and belts extend supply afterwards.
No starter crate includes manufactured goods or bypasses the factory.

Domes, cooling and production compete for buried ice. A rushed colony spreads
cheap independent facilities and leaks coolant; it grows fast and then needs
constant ice supply. A planned colony shares dome coverage, uses short sealed
pipes and upgrades cooling. Show ice consumption and the remaining supply.
The factory's pressure requirement must not create a bootstrap deadlock.

### The Sun: trade a burst of output for sustained operation

Establish a Collector Wing and Crew Ring, then an Assembly Platform, parts,
claimed Furnace Mind and Plasma Scoops. Bring forward familiar belts and
coolant connections. Radiators become a meaningful investment as heat grows.

The rushed route adds collectors and intensive scoops, obtaining a quick burst
while approaching the existing heat throttle. A balanced route adds cooling,
uses efficient machines and avoids oversized production that cannot be fed.
Preserve the Bottled Sun rule: only plasma actually extracted contributes to
the reserve. Plasma destroyed through careless extraction contributes nothing,
so an early shortcut has a real consequence in the next two worlds.

### The Solar System: live on the energy already banked

Arrive near the existing protected Depot. Establish a Station, relay coverage,
power connections and an Orbital Factory; manufacture parts and build a claimed
Orbital Datacentre. Connect Asteroid Miners to production through belts while
respecting the existing relay shipping requirement.

The Bottled Sun powers the network; there is no new solar generator here.
Sprawling, constantly running machinery gives quick capacity but drains the
reserve. Short shared routes, targeted output, efficient processing and lower
coolant demand give more useful production before the reserve empties. Show
reserve use and an estimated runtime at the current draw. Manual harvesting
remains possible after power is exhausted.

### The Universe: the endgame reflects earlier choices

Existing World Engines retain their compute role. Add a Cosmic Foundry and
stage-appropriate parts for a claimed Matrioshka Shell, then expand Galaxy
Siphons and their supply network. Existing engine compute may help bootstrap;
new datacentres still require manufacturing and claims.

Efficient infrastructure stretches the remaining energy and dark cold. A
speedrunner can use cheap intensive machinery and the existing irreversible
option to render a World Engine for an immediate energy burst, accepting the
lost compute and recorded consequence. Preserve both the exhaustion ending and
the unanimous restraint ending. Conservation must not be required to finish.
The endgame should reveal what the group consumed, wasted and preserved, and
how long its machines stayed useful, through actual measured state.

World transitions still happen when natural deposits are exhausted. Buildings,
claims, buffers and ordinary inventory reset with the world; identity, history,
archive and the existing Bottled Sun carry forward. Do not silently carry
upgrades. The bounded Green Lobby restoration below is the only new stock source. Rebalance raw starter bundles so the
whole bootstrap is possible without skipping manufacturing. Conservation on
Earth/Mars pays off locally; the Sun's extracted reserve and later efficiency
provide the explicit mechanical link to endgame endurance.

## The other side: the Green Lobby

The players are the ones digging Earth up to get to a datacentre. Add an
opposing side: **environmental lobby agents** who are against the
datacentre and keep **putting resources back** into the world.

- They're server-run characters (not players), drawn like players but clearly
  different: their own look, a name ("Fern", "Moss" or similar), and a little
  placard or sign. They walk the map on the server tick, so every open browser
  sees the same lobbyist in the same place.
- **They replant.** A lobbyist walks to a deposit the players have harvested
  down (a stump, a dry pond, a dug-out ore pit) and puts stock back into it,
  a little at a time. The tile visibly recovers.
- **They push back harder as the datacentre gets closer.** A few lobbyists at
  the start, more once a Factory runs, and more again for each Datacentre.
  They can also picket a Datacentre site: stand beside it and slow its
  construction, or protest with a speech bubble. Pick what reads best and is
  fun, but it must never permanently block a player.
- **It's a tug of war, not a stalemate.** Restoration has to be bounded or
  the world never ends. Give the lobby a finite seed bank (for example a
  share of the world's initial stock) that runs dry. Players can also
  outpace them, so a world can always be finished.
- **The books still balance.** Replanted stock is new stock entering the
  world, so it can't appear off the books. Add a ledger column for it (for
  example `restored`) and make the identity `initial + restored = remaining +
  extracted + destroyed`. Update `ledgerHolds`, the transition summary table
  and the tests to match. The seed bank also means the total can never
  exceed a known bound.
- **Earth first.** The lobby is strongest on Earth, where there's something
  living to put back. Decide whether it follows the players to later worlds,
  and how, and write that decision down in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Keep the
  restraint ending in the Universe intact.
- **Every lobby action is logged on the server** like player actions, with
  the lobbyist's name, the tile and the amount, so `flyctl logs` shows both
  sides of the fight.
- The HUD shows that the lobby exists: how many lobbyists are active, how
  much of their seed bank is left, and a log line when they replant
  ("Fern replanted the Old Oak's grove").

### Integrating the lobby with factory progression

Preserve the Green Lobby above alongside the fast and sustainable routes. Its
finite seed bank is the sole explicit exception to the base finite-stock rule:
restoration is bounded new stock, recorded in `restored`, and never an unlimited
renewable resource. Sustainable machinery still saves inputs rather than
creating them. A world ends at exact deposit exhaustion; a remaining seed bank
must not resurrect a world after its transition has begun. Lobby actions stop
in transition, ended and empty-room states. Initialise and persist a per-world
seed bank, restored counters and lobbyists; migrated ledgers start at zero
restored. Define the bank's allocation by resource family so ore and coolant
cannot be created from an unbounded generic balance.

Keep opposition readable and avoid making sustainability a way to bypass the
whole production chain. Picketing can slow construction but must have a bounded
effect; it cannot steal ownership or permanently prevent completion. Measure
both play strategies with the lobby active. Test replanting, bank exhaustion,
resource-family bounds, the extended ledger, save/load and eventual campaign
completion. The new ledger identity explicitly replaces the old identity in
the supplied harness for this feature; preserve all other invariants.

## Claims, permissions and cooperation

Add a claim command for a small plot, such as 4x4 tiles, with a modest cost or
per-player cap. Display its boundary in the owner's colour and name. The
server refuses other players' construction or demolition inside it. A
Datacentre must fit entirely inside its builder's claim. Claims never block
walking, hand harvesting or access to deposits.

Keep unclaimed ordinary construction possible. Do not let a new claim capture
someone else's existing buildings or infrastructure. Players may connect at
exposed network endpoints without gaining demolition or reconfiguration rights.
Owners control their buildings, recipes, upgrades and lines; the host retains
an explicit recovery override consistent with current demolition powers.
Claims and machines survive temporary disconnection. Document the exact rules
in `docs/DECISIONS.md` or an ADR, including host powers and shared supply.

## Feedback and player experience

- The goal checklist explains the next useful action and why: gather ore,
  house workers, connect power, make parts, claim ground, cool the datacentre,
  automate a supply line, then inspect a bottleneck.
- Build previews show raw and goods costs, ownership conflicts, network
  connections and operating needs. Use specific messages such as "needs 6
  wire (have 2)", "claim this ground first" and "that's Ada's land".
- Inspect panels show current throughput, expected inputs per output, power
  draw, coolant use, buffer fill and a plain-language idle reason. Network
  overlays make breaks and overloaded sections visible without relying on
  colour alone. Keep touch controls practical on mobile.
- Track useful production, resource waste, coolant consumption, energy draw
  and renewable share where renewable power exists. Compare rates and totals
  separately; a fast machine and an efficient machine are different choices.
  Never label the finite Bottled Sun as renewable electricity.
- Consequences should be readable in the world and operational feedback:
  damaged places, shrinking sources, stalled input, heat throttling and lower
  reserve. Keep the Cooperative's warm tone and avoid moralising popups.
- Log claims, builds, demolitions, upgrades, mode/recipe changes and factory
  batches server-side with actor id/name, room and stage. Autonomous batches
  identify the owning player and machine. Network placement can be one log
  entry per completed path rather than one entry per tile. Never log tokens.

## Rules that still hold

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Keep all invariants, server ownership,
origin checks, explicit `.ts` imports and existing renderer/HUD update boundaries.

- Validate commands, costs, bounds, permissions, connections and transfers in
  `shared/sim.ts`. Client previews never determine an outcome.
- Extend the ledger to `initial + restored = remaining + extracted + destroyed`
  for the Green Lobby and keep `ledgerHolds` true.
  Manufactured goods and local buffers are whole-number, nonnegative stores,
  separate from the natural-stock ledger. Transfers conserve their contents.
- Define bounded storage and backpressure: a full destination stops delivery;
  a disconnected belt cannot delete or duplicate items. Deleting a line or
  machine returns its buffered contents exactly once, separately from salvage.
  Salvage of the structure and installed upgrades is strictly below paid cost.
- Persist batch progress, pipe-loss counters, goods, claims, infrastructure,
  buffers and upgrades. Bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `SCHEMA_VERSION`; migrate
  old saves in `server/store.ts` with safe defaults and existing datacentres
  retained. Give legacy buildings a documented compatibility supply mode or
  valid initial connections so loading an old room does not break its economy.
- Keep balance values in `shared/content.ts`. Integer batch counters can express
  reduced consumption without fractional inventory. Test mode switches and
  reconnects so players cannot evade costs or duplicate batch outputs.
- Empty rooms pause, ended campaigns stay ended, and stage boundaries are saved
  before announcement. No new factory milestone blocks exact exhaustion.

## Implementation and acceptance

Implement in manageable steps: goods and the bootstrap chain; claims; simple
local buffers and networks; fast/careful operation and upgrades; all-world
balance and feedback. Finish a working version of all four network types.
Prefer simpler complete mechanics over decorative connections or unfinished
simulation features.

Update `scripts/playbot.ts` for both rushed and sustainable strategies. Both
must establish workers and power, manufacture parts, claim ground, build a
datacentre and use at least one working automated supply line. Run complete
campaigns at `rapid` pace. Measure normal-pace Earth with identical seeds and
player counts, including a hand-harvest-only baseline. Compare time to first
factory/datacentre, useful output, wasted stock, coolant used and energy used.
Also test late-stage runtime with an equal starting reserve. Sustainable setups
must show a measurable efficiency/endurance benefit after their setup cost;
rushed setups must retain an early speed advantage and remain completable.
Record real results and tuning in `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/TESTING.md`.

Add focused simulation tests for:

- The first factory and datacentre are reachable without pre-existing compute
  or manufactured goods, using baseline workers on every stage.
- Datacentres are refused without parts, outside claims or on another player's
  claim; claims do not block harvesting and cannot capture another's assets.
- Recipes consume the correct inputs, preserve the natural ledger, and cannot
  duplicate work through switching, pausing, reconnecting or save/load.
- Intensive harvesting is faster but wastes real stock; careful harvesting
  preserves more useful stock, including when only one or two units remain.
- Disconnected power, empty coolant and blocked/full belts produce correct
  idle states; forks, loops and simultaneous transfers conserve resources.
- Pipe losses and cooling recovery are accounted for exactly; upgrades do not
  create water, energy or raw stock, and demolition cannot yield profit.
- Efficient operation saves inputs for a comparable useful output, while the
  rushed route can complete without buying sustainable upgrades.
- All five stage bootstraps, legacy-save migration, exact exhaustion, both
  endings and the empty-room pause still work.

Update the player guide in `README.md`, building/recipe/network tables in
`docs/DESIGN.md`, and the relevant decisions/architecture documentation. Test
the real built UI at desktop and mobile sizes, including placing/removing a
line, recovering from a shortage and a two-player ownership conflict. Run
`pnpm check` with its required running server and keep `main` deployable.
Delete this `prompt.md` in the implementation agent's last commit, as required
by the supplied riff harness.
